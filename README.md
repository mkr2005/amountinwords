# Bizmitra Amount in Words

A simple Laravel package to convert numeric amounts into their equivalent words.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer. Run the following command in your Laravel project's root directory:

```bash
composer require bizmitra/amountinwords

Usage
Step 1: Service Provider Registration
Laravel should automatically detect the service provider. However, if you want to manually register it, add the following line to the providers array in your config/app.php file:

'providers' => [
    // Other Service Providers

    Bizmitra\Amountinwords\AmountinwordsServiceProvider::class,
],


Step 2: Using the Package
You can use the PrintAmountInWords class in your controllers or anywhere in your Laravel application. Hereâ€™s an example:

Example Controller
Create a new controller using the following command:

php artisan make:controller AmountController


Then, use the following code in your AmountController.php:

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Bizmitra\Amountinwords\PrintAmountInWords;

class AmountController extends Controller
{
    protected $amountInWords;

    public function __construct(PrintAmountInWords $amountInWords)
    {
        $this->amountInWords = $amountInWords;
    }

    public function index()
    {
        $amount = 12345; // Example amount
        $words = $this->amountInWords->displayWords($amount);

        return response()->json([
            'amount' => $amount,
            'in_words' => $words,
        ]);
    }
}
Step 3: Create a Route
You can create a route to access the controller in your routes/web.php (or routes/api.php) file:

use App\Http\Controllers\AmountController;

Route::get('/amount-in-words', [AmountController::class, 'index']);

{
    "amount": 12345,
    "in_words": "TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE"
}


Step 4: Accessing the Functionality
Now, when you access the /amount-in-words route in your browser or through an API client like Postman, you should get a JSON response with the amount in words:

Step 5: Testing the Functionality
Make sure to test your functionality by accessing the route you created and verifying that it returns the correct output.
